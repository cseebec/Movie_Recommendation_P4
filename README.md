# Introduction to movie_recommendation_P4
Use machine learning packages in python to create two movie recommendation systems (one content based and one collaborative based)

### About Recommendation Systems
First of all what is a recommendation system? A recommendation system is software that analyzes data so that it can make predictions for things that a user might enjoy. 
Today recommendation systems are in everything we do, a few quick examples of companies with recommendation systems are Amazon, Youtube, Netflix, and even Tinder. Here is a screenshots of Netflix's recommendation systems:

### Types of Recommendation Systems
There are four types of recommendation systems

1. **Content Based** â€“ system takes attributes of product/s that the user likes and suggests other products with similar attributes
  * For Example: If I go onto Amazon and buy a hammer. Amazon might suggest that I buy other hammers, screws, or wrenches because they are all tools
2. **Collaborative Based** - within collaborative based systems there are actually multiple recommendation systems: item-item based filtering and user-item based filtering
  * **Item-item based filtering** - looks at items users have already purchased / used in the past and recommends similar items.
    * Similar items - in this model are measured by how similarly they are rated by users
    * Item-item based filtering was invented by Amazon and it is still used by Amazon today
    * Item-item based filtering is less resource intensive than user-user based filtering and easier to implement for new users
  * **User-item based filtering** - groups users together based on whether or not they share similar habits and recommends products to users that other users in their group have enjoyed
    * Very effective algorithm but very time and resource intensive 
3. **Popularity Based** - recommends the most popular products
4. **Hybrid Model** - combination of two or more of the systems above

* In this repo I will create 2 models, one will be content based and one will be collaborative based. Popularity Based and Hybrid Models are both effective models but they just are not used in this repo

# System Requirements

There are only 2 coding softwares used in this repo: **Python version 3** and **Microsoft Excel**

Additionally, there libraries within Python that you will want to have installed before jumping here

### Python Libraries
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Numpy
* Sklearn
  * From .metrics.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
  * From .metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
  * From .feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
  * From .neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
  * From .metrics.pairwise import linear_kernel

# Data Sources
In this repo I used two links to gather data. 

1. The first link used in this repo is https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata
  * From this link download both csv files, tmdb_5000_credits.csv and tmdb_5000_movies.csv, these csv files are used in 01_Content_Based_Filtering_System
    * I saved both these csv files to 01_Content_Based_Filtering_System/01_Starting_Datasets
    * Both of these csv files are read into Cleaning Data.ipynb cleaned up, merged together, and the movies.csv file in 01_Content_Based_Filtering_System/01_Starting_Datasets is just the cleaned up version of these files. 

2. The second link used in this repo is https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/
  * From this link download ml-latest.zip 
    * Within this zip folder there are multiple csv files the only 2 used in this repo are movies.csv and ratings.csv
    * Both these csv files are used in Movie_Recommender.ipynb

# Data Analysis 

### Content Based
There are two python scripts for performing data analysis for the content based model, "Cleaning Dataset.ipynb" and "Content_Movie_Recommendation_System.ipynb"

"Cleaning Dataset.ipynb" as the name states cleans the csv files and exports a cleaned csv file that can be used to create the model. Some of the functions used in the script are for loops, split, replace, and merge

"Content_Movie_Recommendation_System.ipynb" again as the name states creates a Content Based Movie Recommendation System. The script creates the recommendation system using mainly count vectorizer (to convert strings to numeric values) and cosine similarity matrices (to find the similarity between 2 strings). Then the script evaluates the model using a TF-IDF (Terms Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency) model and K nearest neighbors to see how many of the genres of the predicted movies exactly match the genres of the movies the prediction was based on. See the Content Based Section below in the Conclusion section for more information on the evalualation of this model and the conclusions. 

### Collaborative Based
There is only one python script for this recommendation system, "Movie_Recommender.ipynb". 

Steps to analyze the data
1.  Clean the data
2.  Remove data that is unneccesary to the code
  * Use matplotlib to help visualize this rating data


# Conclusions

### Content Based
One of the more challenging aspects of this project was identifying a way to evaluate this model. This model is an unsupervised machine learning model and there are no objectively "correct" recommendations it is a subjective topic. So evaluating the sucess of the model was a difficult hurdle because standard machine learning metrics like R-squared score and mean squared error cannot be used. So, I decided that my metric for the success of this model would be predicted movie genres exactly matched the genre of the movie that it was recommended based on. 

![](04_Images/Picture1.png)

As the table shows, using this metric the recommendation system performed very well. The recommendation system suggested movies that matched the genres of original movie 92% of the time.

However, this model is certainly not a perfect recommendation system for many reasons. 
1. It only has 5,000 movies this seems like a lot but a lot of movies are not included
2. Only goes up to 2017
3. Does not factor in user prefences or popularity it only focuses on purely the content of the movies
